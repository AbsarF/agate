Ranking is a complicated science. agate strives to find a balance between simple, intuitive ranking and flexibility when you need it.

Percentile rank
===============

"Percentile rank" is a bit of a misnomer. Really, this is the percentile in which each value in a column is located. This column can be computed for your data using the :class:`.PercentileRank` computation:

.. code-block:: Python

    from agate import PercentileRank

    new_table = table.compute([
        ('percentile_rank', PercentileRank('value')
    ])

Note that there is no entirely standard method for computing percentiles. The percentiles computed in this manner may not agree with those generated by other programes. See the :class:`.Percentiles` class documentation for implementation details.
